# What is this

A repo containing the files that CODAL requires of the nRF5SDK for our BLE implementation.

This is a fork of the [original from Micro:bit](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/codal-microbit-nrf5sdk). It uses the S140 SoftDevice (instead of the S113) and has the SDK files related to the scanning module.

***THIS IS NOT A MIRROR OF THE Nordic SDK. It will probably be missing many files. We are intentionally keeping this lean.***

## Modifying this library - Currently broken see [issue #3](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/codal-microbit-nrf5sdk/issues/3)

If a new header or source file from the SDK is required for future CODAL micro:bit development:

1. Download the nRF5SDK from the [Nordic website](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Software/nRF5-SDK/Download#infotabs). Unpack it so that the SDK is in a folder `../nRF5SDK/` compared to the root of this repository. This will typically be `codal/libraries/nRF5SDK`

2. Add it to CMakeLists.txt

`APPEND INCLUDE_SDK_DIRS "${SDK_DIRECTORY}/nRF5SDK/{directory}"`

`APPEND SOURCE_FILES "${SDK_DIRECTORY}/nRFSDK/{path to file}.c`

3. Run `cmake . -D REGENERATE=True` to update the `./nRF5SDK` folder in this repository

4. Commit, push, create a PR!
